Notewise
========

Working with your knowledge and ideas is the most important thing you
do: every other task, no matter how urgent, is ultimately supplemental.
Notewise is a next-generation tool that lets you capture and refine your
personal knowledge as it accumulates, and keeps it safe for easy
retrieval. From little scraps of information to rich insights into
complex domains, with Notewise you can always remember what you once
knew.
